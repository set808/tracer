# Tracer

Tracer is an asset tracker built using Ethereum smart contracts. Initially built as a concept to track gun ownership from manufacturer to seller to buy as part of a side project at Holberton School in San Francisco, it has been modified to be a generalized asset tracking system.

This project is simply an MVP. A real life implementation would have larger considerations.

Languages: Solidity, Web3js, HTML
